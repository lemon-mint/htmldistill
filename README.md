# htmldistill

HTMLDistill is a powerful and efficient library designed to streamline HTML content for optimal processing by Large Language Models (LLMs). It meticulously analyzes HTML documents and removes extraneous elements that may hinder the performance and accuracy of LLMs.

With HTMLDistill, you can easily extract the most relevant and meaningful information from HTML pages by eliminating unnecessary scripts, styles, attributes, and other superfluous content. The library employs advanced algorithms to identify and preserve the essential structure and semantics of the HTML, ensuring that the distilled output is clean, concise, and ready for consumption by LLMs.

Whether you are working on natural language processing tasks, text analysis, or any other application involving LLMs, HTMLDistill simplifies the preprocessing stage by delivering clean and focused HTML content. By eliminating the clutter and preserving the essence, HTMLDistill enables LLMs to achieve better results with improved accuracy and efficiency.

Simplify your HTML preprocessing with HTMLDistill and unlock the full potential of your Large Language Models.

Key features:

1. Intelligent tag filtering: HTMLDistill intelligently identifies and retains only the HTML tags that are significant for LLMs, discarding those that are irrelevant or potentially disruptive.

2. Attribute pruning: The library removes non-essential attributes from the remaining tags, further simplifying the HTML structure and reducing noise.

3. Script and style removal: HTMLDistill automatically strips away inline scripts and style definitions, as they are typically not useful for LLMs and can introduce unnecessary complexity.

4. Customizable configuration: The library provides a flexible configuration system, allowing you to fine-tune the distillation process based on your specific requirements and the needs of your LLM.
